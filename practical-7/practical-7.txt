01.Create a button in your Android app. Write Kotlin code to create an Implicit
Intent that opens a web URL (e.g., "https://www.example.com") in the user's
default web browser when the button is clicked.
02.Add a button in your Android app. Write Kotlin code to create an Implicit
Intent to compose an email with a predefined email address, subject, and body
when the button is clicked.
03.In your Android app, create two activities: FirstActivity and SecondActivity.
Add a button in FirstActivity. Write Kotlin code to create an Explicit Intent to
navigate from FirstActivity to SecondActivity when the button is clicked.
04.Extend the previous question (Q4) by passing a string message (e.g., "Hello
from FirstActivity!") from FirstActivity to SecondActivity using the Explicit
Intent. Display the received message in SecondActivity.
05.Create a simple Android app with a button. When the button is clicked, start a
Foreground Service that displays a persistent notification with a fixed message
(e.g., "Foreground Service is running!") while the app is in the foreground.
06.Implement a Background Service that runs in the background every 10 seconds
and displays a Toast message with a fixed message (e.g., "Background Service
is running!") while the app is in the background.
07.Write Kotlin code to create a Bound Service that responds to a method call
from an Activity. The service should return a random number between 1 and
100 each time the method is called.
08.Create an Unbound Service in Kotlin to download a file from a given URL in
the background
